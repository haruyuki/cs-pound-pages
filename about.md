Or you can call Haru or blumewmew or whichever online name you know me by, nice to meet you!

I am a student living in Australia and have a great passion for coding. This Discord bot is a major project during high school that I have kept running for over 6 years now and unfortunately have not had time recently to provide proper updates to it anymore.

It has become a Discord bot that is commonly used in Chicken Smoothie Discord servers, providing a variety of commands that are useful for server owners and members related to the virtual pet adoption website.

Despite the hiatus in development, it is still in over 1500 servers and thousands of users. I am very grateful for the support that I have received from the community and I hope to continue to provide updates in the future if I regain the motivation.
