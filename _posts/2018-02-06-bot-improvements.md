Another small patch that mainly focuses on the **,pet** command not working with pets that have items on them. This is because the link for pets with items is different from normal pet images, which I didn't account for. But now that is fixed and **,pet** should now also work for pets with items!

This update also comes with a slightly rewritten **,time** command. It should now reply with the pound time much faster. Not exactly sure how much faster, but it is definitely faster!

Changelog:
* Improved repsonse time of **,time** command
* Fixed pets with items not working on **,pet** command
