Currently the **,help** command is just a long list of commands, but now they have been updated! They are now categorised by Chicken Smoothie related, general or information commands. This should hopefully make it easier to look for the commands you need. I've also added in help information for the **,pet2** command.

Changelog:
* Added **,help** command information for **,pet2** command
* Changed **,help** command embed layout

## Command Usage
```
,help pet2
```
