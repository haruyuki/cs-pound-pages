Just some small quality of life changes made to the bot. A note has been added to Remind-Me's help page to show that reminders made with Remind-Me cannot be removed due to how the code for the command has been written.

Changelog:
* Added bot version to **,statistics** command
* Added my Discord tag to bot "Playing" status
* Changed **,help** info of Remind-Me
* Removed unimplemented commands listed in **,help**
* Removed bot version from bot "Playing" status
